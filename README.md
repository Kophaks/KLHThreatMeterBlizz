# This AddOn requires KLHThreatMeter to work which is NOT included

KLHThreatMeterBlizz adds a small threat indicator to your target frame that will also change color depenging on your current threat.
It shows data directly from KLHThreatMeter, which unfortunetly means that it will **not** be accurate when there are many monsters around and there is no work around this in 1.12 patch. Sorry!
